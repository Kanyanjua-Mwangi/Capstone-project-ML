Football Player Overall Rating Prediction
Introduction
In today's era, data-driven decision making has become crucial not only in corporate boardrooms but also in various departments within organizations. The football industry is no exception, where scouting and training institutions heavily rely on data analysis and machine learning models to make informed decisions. This project aims to develop a predictive model for the overall rating of football players using data from the football_players dataset.

Project Overview
The project follows a structured approach starting with Data Exploration to understand the relevance of each feature to the target variable. Feature engineering techniques are then applied to refine attributes and align them with underlying data patterns. Machine learning techniques are employed to construct predictive models tailored to the dataset. The goal is to select the model with the highest forecast accuracy to project the expected overall rating of a football player, providing a key metric for decision-making processes.
